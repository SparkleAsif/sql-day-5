What is a CREATE VIEW Statement in SQL?
A VIEW in SQL is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query. It does not store data itself but retrieves data from underlying tables whenever it is queried. You can think of it as a saved query that simplifies complex operations or abstracts data access.

Syntax

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Why Use Views?
Simplify Queries: Encapsulate complex joins or calculations.
Security: Restrict user access to specific columns or rows.
Reusability: Use the view in multiple queries without rewriting the SQL logic.
Maintainability: Abstract underlying table structure changes from end users.
Examples
1. Basic View Creation
Create a view to display high-salary employees.

CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
You can now query the view as:

SELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees;
2. View with Aggregates
Create a view to display the total sales for each product.

CREATE VIEW TotalSales AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM(price * quantity) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;
Query the view:

SELECT * FROM TotalSales WHERE total_sales > 10000;
3. View with Joins
Create a view to show customer orders with product details.

CREATE VIEW CustomerOrders AS
SELECT customers.name AS customer_name, orders.order_id, products.product_name, orders.quantity
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;
Query the view:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM CustomerOrders WHERE customer_name = 'John Doe';
Updating a View
You can update an existing view using the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT employee_id, name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
Dropping a View
To remove a view, use the DROP VIEW statement.

DROP VIEW HighSalaryEmployees;
Limitations of Views
Views do not store data; they depend on the underlying tables.
Some views may not support INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations, especially if they involve complex joins or aggregates.
Changes in the underlying table structure may require modifying the view.
Practice Questions
