What is the HAVING Clause in SQL?
The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of groups created by the GROUP BY clause. Unlike the WHERE clause, which filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups after aggregate functions have been applied.

Syntax

SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
Key Points
HAVING is typically used with aggregate functions (e.g., SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc.).
It filters groups of rows, not individual rows.
WHERE and HAVING can be used together in a query.
Examples
1. Basic HAVING Example
Find departments with a total salary greater than 50,000.

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
Result:

department	total_salary
IT	70000
HR	60000
2. Using HAVING with COUNT()
Find departments with more than 5 employees.

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
Result:

department	employee_count
IT	8
HR	6
3. Combining WHERE and HAVING
Find departments with a total salary greater than 50,000, but only include employees hired after 2020.

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
WHERE filters rows based on the hire date before grouping.
HAVING filters groups based on the total salary.
4. Using Multiple Conditions in HAVING
Find departments with a total salary greater than 50,000 and less than 100,000.

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000 AND SUM(salary) < 100000;
